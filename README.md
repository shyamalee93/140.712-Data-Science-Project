Zillow's Home Value Prediction - Zestimate

Zestimates are Zillow's estimated home values and as the margin of error in the predicted value(s) and the actual value(s) have been consistently reducing, their estimates are trusted across the country. The aim of this Kaggle project is to further reduce their margin of error from what they have it at now.
